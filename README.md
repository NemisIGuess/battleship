# Battlelship

A version of the game Battleship made as part of The Odin Project JavaScript course.

## How it works

You will deploy your ships on a 10x10 grid at the same time as your opponent.
Once both sides have deployed the ships both will take turns trying to find out where your opponent ships are.
To do so you will input coordinates on the game board trying to guess where their ships are.
If you manage to hit one of their ships you will see it on their board, try to hit the rest of the ship.

The first player to sink all their opponent ships will win.
For reference there are:

- 1 ship of size 5: The Carrier
- 1 ship of size 4: The Battleship
- 2 ship of size 3: A Destroyer and a Submarine
- 1 ship of size 2: The Patrol Boat

You can also play the Salvo mode where you take as many shots as ships you have left alive, if you manage to hit an enemy ship you won't take an extra turn in this mode.
